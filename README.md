# C# Docker Day 1 Exercise

## Learning Objectives

- Create a Spring Application with the usual end points
- Practice deploying the Spring Application to a Docker Container

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your machine
3. Open the project in IntelliJ

## Core

Create an API with the usual GET/PUT/POST/DELETE endpoints. 

The API should serve user data for students attending a bootcamp.

The data for students should include:

* Unique ID
* First Name
* Last Name
* Date of Birth
* Course Title
* Start Date for Course
* Average Grade 

Your API should connect to an ElephantSQL database instance that can be used for storing the data.

Create a `jar` file for the completed application.

Create a `Dockerfile` and any other associated files to allow you to deploy the application using a Docker Container.

Do not share your credentials in the `application.yml` file. 

To assess this we will clone your repository, add our own credentials to the cloned repository and use those to test that the application works as expected.

## Extension

In addition to the Student details add in details of different Courses and reference them from the Student details as a Foreign Key relationship. The endpoints for Courses should be completed as expected.
